# Consumer Confidence Survey - December 2024

## The Conference Board

The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index increased to 104.7 in December, up from 101.4 in November. The Present Situation Index, which measures consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions, rose to 140.2 from 136.5. The Expectations Index, based on consumers' short-term outlook for income, business, and labor market conditions, improved to 81.1 from 78.3.

"Consumer confidence continued its recovery in December after two consecutive monthly declines earlier in the fall," said Dana M. Peterson, Chief Economist at The Conference Board. "The uptick reflects improved consumer views of the current labor market and business conditions."

### Labor Market Assessment

Consumers' views of the labor market were more favorable in December. The share of consumers saying jobs are "plentiful" increased to 33.4 percent from 31.4 percent. Meanwhile, the percentage saying jobs are "hard to get" decreased to 16.1 percent from 17.2 percent. The labor differential (jobs plentiful minus jobs hard to get) widened to 17.3 percentage points, signaling continued labor market resilience.

### Income and Business Expectations

Consumers' outlook for future income prospects improved modestly. The share of consumers expecting their incomes to increase rose to 17.6 percent from 16.9 percent. Those expecting a decrease in income fell to 12.4 percent.

Views on future business conditions were mixed. The proportion expecting business conditions to improve increased to 18.7 percent, while 20.3 percent expect conditions to worsen over the next six months.

### Inflation Expectations

Consumers' 12-month inflation expectations held steady at 5.4 percent in December. This remains above the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target, suggesting consumers continue to anticipate elevated price pressures in the year ahead.

### Spending Intentions

Consumers' purchasing plans were little changed in December. Intentions to buy homes within six months remained subdued at 4.8 percent, likely reflecting high mortgage rates. Plans to purchase automobiles held steady at 11.2 percent.

The Consumer Confidence Survey is based on a representative sample of approximately 3,000 U.S. households. The monthly survey has been conducted since 1967 and uses 1985 as the base year (1985=100).
