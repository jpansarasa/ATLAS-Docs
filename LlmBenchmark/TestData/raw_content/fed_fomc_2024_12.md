## Federal Open Market Committee Statement

The Federal Open Market Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Since earlier in the year, labor market conditions have generally eased, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low at 4.2 percent. Inflation has made progress toward the Committee's 2 percent objective but remains somewhat elevated at 2.4 percent.

The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.

In support of its goals, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4.25 to 4.5 percent. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee expects that ongoing reductions in the policy rate will be appropriate if inflation continues to move sustainably toward 2 percent and the labor market remains solid.

The Committee anticipates that the federal funds rate will decline to approximately 3.9 percent by the end of 2025, according to the median projection of FOMC participants. The Committee projects that inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index, will be 2.5 percent in 2025 before returning to the 2 percent target by 2026.

The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.

In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals.

Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Thomas I. Barkin; Michael S. Barr; Raphael W. Bostic; Michelle W. Bowman; Lisa D. Cook; Mary C. Daly; Beth M. Hammack; Philip N. Jefferson; Adriana D. Kugler; and Christopher J. Waller.

### Summary of Economic Projections

The Summary of Economic Projections shows the median participant expects real GDP growth of 2.5 percent in 2024 and 2.1 percent in 2025. The unemployment rate is expected to remain stable at 4.3 percent through 2025.

Core PCE inflation is projected to decline from 2.8 percent in 2024 to 2.5 percent in 2025, with the Committee maintaining confidence that inflation will return to 2 percent over time, though the path may be gradual.

The federal funds rate projections indicate that, if economic conditions evolve as anticipated, the median participant expects the appropriate level of the federal funds rate to be 3.9 percent at the end of 2025 and 3.4 percent at the end of 2026.
