Respondents' comments reflect a wait-and-see approach to capital expenditure decisions amid economic uncertainty.

**Chemical Products**: "Demand is improving but still below expectations. Customers continue to delay orders pending tariff clarity from the incoming administration."

**Computer & Electronic Products**: "New orders are picking up heading into Q1 2025. Lead times from Asian suppliers have stabilized at approximately 8-10 weeks."

**Fabricated Metal Products**: "Employment remains challenged due to skilled labor shortages. We cannot find qualified welders and machinists despite raising wages 12 percent over the past year."

**Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products**: "Commodity prices, especially cocoa and coffee, continue to rise. We expect to pass through approximately 5-7 percent price increases to customers in early 2025."

**Machinery**: "Backlogs are declining as we work through existing orders. New order activity is soft with customers citing uncertainty about 2025 capital budgets."

**Transportation Equipment**: "Production ramp-up continues despite ongoing supply chain challenges. Electric vehicle battery constraints remain our primary bottleneck."
