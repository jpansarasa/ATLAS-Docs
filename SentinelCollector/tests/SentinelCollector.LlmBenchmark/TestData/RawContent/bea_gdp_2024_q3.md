## Bureau of Economic Analysis - U.S. Department of Commerce

**Release Date:** December 19, 2024
**Data Reference Period:** Q3 2024

Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 3.1 percent in the third quarter of 2024, according to the "third" estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In the second quarter, real GDP increased 3.0 percent.

The GDP estimate released today is based on more complete source data than were available for the "second" estimate issued last month. In the second estimate, the increase in real GDP was 2.8 percent. The update primarily reflected an upward revision to consumer spending.

The increase in real GDP primarily reflected increases in consumer spending, exports, federal government spending, and nonresidential fixed investment. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, increased.

Gross private domestic investment increased 0.8 percent, contributing 0.14 percentage points to GDP growth.
