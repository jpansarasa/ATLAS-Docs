# Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy
## Speech by Governor Christopher J. Waller

**Location:** American Enterprise Institute, Washington, D.C.
**Date:** December 2, 2024

Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today about the economic outlook and the implications for monetary policy.

### Economic Conditions

The U.S. economy continues to perform well. Real GDP grew at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the third quarter, following growth of 3.0 percent in Q2. Consumer spending has remained resilient, supported by a strong labor market and moderating inflation.

The labor market has gradually cooled from its overheated state of 2022 and early 2023. The unemployment rate stood at 4.1 percent in October, up from 3.7 percent a year ago but still historically low. Monthly job gains have averaged around 170,000 over the past three months, down from over 250,000 a year ago.

Job openings have declined from their peak of 12.2 million in March 2022 to 7.4 million in September 2024. The ratio of job openings to unemployed workers has fallen from 2.0 to 1.1, suggesting the labor market is closer to balance.

### Inflation Progress

Inflation has made considerable progress toward our 2 percent target. The 12-month PCE inflation rate was 2.3 percent in October, down from 3.0 percent a year ago. Core PCE inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was 2.8 percent, down from 3.4 percent.

Housing services inflation remains elevated at 5.4 percent but is expected to moderate as the lagged effects of slower rent growth feed through to the index.

Looking ahead, I expect inflation to continue declining toward 2 percent over the next year. Market-based measures of inflation expectations remain well anchored around 2.3 percent.

### Monetary Policy

Given the progress on inflation and the gradual cooling of the labor market, I supported the FOMC's decision to reduce the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at our November meeting, bringing the target range to 4.50 to 4.75 percent.

Looking ahead, I believe further reductions in the policy rate will likely be appropriate if inflation continues to moderate and the labor market remains stable. The pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data.

If we see inflation progress stalling or reversing, we would need to reconsider the pace of policy easing. Conversely, if the labor market weakens more than expected, we might need to move more quickly.

I estimate the neutral rate of interest is somewhere between 2.5 percent and 3.0 percent. This suggests we still have room to reduce rates while maintaining a modestly restrictive stance.

### Risks and Uncertainties

The economic outlook remains uncertain. Potential tariff increases could put upward pressure on inflation in the near term. Geopolitical tensions and fiscal policy decisions add to this uncertainty.

On the positive side, productivity growth has surprised to the upside, running at 2.2 percent over the past year. If sustained, this could support continued economic growth while helping contain inflationary pressures.

Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.
