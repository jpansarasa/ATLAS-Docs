# Remarks by Governor Christopher J. Waller
## Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy Considerations
### Federal Reserve Board, December 18, 2024

Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today about the economic outlook and some considerations for monetary policy going forward.

## Current Economic Conditions

Let me begin with where we are. The economy has proven remarkably resilient over the past year. Real GDP grew at a solid 2.8 percent annual rate in the third quarter of 2024, and the labor market remains historically strong. The unemployment rate stood at 4.1 percent in November, and we have seen payroll gains averaging around 170,000 jobs per month over the past six months. These are signs of a healthy economy.

Inflation has come down substantially from its peak. The 12-month change in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index was 2.3 percent in October, down from over 7 percent in mid-2022. Core PCE inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was 2.8 percent over the same period. While these readings are encouraging, we are not yet at our 2 percent target.

## Outlook and Projections

Looking ahead, I expect the economy to continue growing at a moderate pace in 2025, likely in the range of 2.0 to 2.5 percent. However, there is considerable uncertainty around this forecast. If consumer spending remains robust and business investment continues to recover, we could see growth closer to the upper end of that range.

The labor market should remain solid, with the unemployment rate likely to edge up modestly to around 4.2 to 4.4 percent by the end of 2025. This would still represent a historically healthy labor market, but the gradual cooling suggests supply and demand are coming into better balance.

On inflation, I anticipate continued progress toward our 2 percent goal. My baseline expectation is that core PCE inflation will decline to approximately 2.4 percent by mid-2025 and reach 2.2 percent by year-end. However, this path is contingent on several factors, including the continued easing of shelter inflation and the absence of significant supply shocks.

## Policy Considerations

Regarding monetary policy, I believe we are well-positioned to be patient and data-dependent. If inflation continues to move toward our 2 percent target as I expect, it would be appropriate to continue the gradual reduction in the policy rate that we began in September.

Should the labor market weaken more than anticipated, with unemployment rising above 4.5 percent and payroll gains falling below 100,000 per month, I would support a faster pace of rate cuts to prevent an unwarranted cooling of economic activity. Conversely, if inflation proves stickier than expected, remaining above 2.5 percent through the first half of 2025, we may need to hold rates steady for longer than currently anticipated.

The neutral rate of interest, in my estimation, is likely in the range of 2.5 to 3.0 percent. With the current policy rate at 4.25 to 4.50 percent, policy remains restrictive, which is appropriate given that inflation is still above target.

## Risks and Uncertainties

I want to emphasize the significant uncertainty surrounding these projections. The inflation outlook, in particular, faces both upside and downside risks. On the upside, potential tariff increases could push up goods prices, and any resurgence in energy prices would flow through to headline inflation. On the downside, a sharper-than-expected slowdown in housing costs or a deterioration in global growth could accelerate disinflation.

The labor market presents its own set of uncertainties. While current indicators suggest gradual normalization, history shows that labor markets can turn quickly. I will be watching initial jobless claims, the quits rate, and the ratio of job openings to unemployed workers closely for any signs of rapid deterioration.

## Conclusion

In summary, the economy is in a good place, but we must remain vigilant. I expect continued moderate growth, a healthy labor market, and further progress on inflation in 2025. Policy will need to remain flexible and responsive to incoming data. If the economy evolves as I expect, gradual rate reductions will be appropriate. But we stand ready to adjust our approach if conditions warrant.

Thank you for your attention. I look forward to your questions.
