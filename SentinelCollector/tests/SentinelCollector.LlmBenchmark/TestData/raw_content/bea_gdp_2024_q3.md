The advance estimate released today is based on source data that are incomplete or subject to further revision. The second estimate, based on more complete data, will be released on November 27, 2024.

### GDP Highlights

The increase in real GDP in the third quarter primarily reflected increases in consumer spending, exports, and federal government spending that were partly offset by a decrease in residential fixed investment. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, increased.

The deceleration in real GDP in the third quarter primarily reflected a downturn in private inventory investment and a deceleration in residential fixed investment. These movements were partly offset by accelerations in exports and federal government spending.
